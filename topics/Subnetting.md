# Subnetting

Subnetting is the process of dividing a larger network into smaller, more manageable sub-networks.

### Example
Given IP: `192.168.1.0/24` (Class C network)
- Subnet Mask: `255.255.255.0`
- 4 Subnets: `192.168.1.0/26`, `192.168.1.64/26`, `192.168.1.128/26`, `192.168.1.192/26`

### Key Points
- Subnetting helps in more efficient use of IP addresses.
- Use of **CIDR** allows for more flexible subnetting.
